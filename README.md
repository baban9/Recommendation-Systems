# Recommendation-Systems
In today’s world a customer is flooded with choices when it comes to buying or renting books under any genre. Customers waste a lot of time browsing through an ocean of books to find the ones that suit his/her taste and if even after browsing he could not find one, he/she might look for recommendations from others. Sometimes even after consulting others the customer loses interests and gives up.

This is where we come in, we will be building a recommender system that will help the customers choose their choice of books based on previous choices of the customer. Including recommendations in systems is an attractive bet. For the customers, it increases their experience and creates engagement. For the business, it generates more revenue.

On the Internet, where the choice of decisions is overwhelming, there is a need to channel, organize and effectively convey important data to mitigate the issue of data over-burden, which has made a possible issue to numerous Internet users.

Data recovery frameworks, for example, Google, DevilFinder and Altavista have incompletely tackled this issue however prioritization and personalization (where a framework maps accessible substance to client's inclinations and inclinations) of data were missing. This has expanded the interest in recommender frameworks like never previously.

This is hence not surprising that during the most recent couple of years, with the ascent of YouTube, Amazon, Netflix and numerous other such web services, recommender frameworks have assumed increasingly more positions in our lives. From internet business (propose to purchasers’ articles that could intrigue them) to online commercials (propose to clients the correct substance, coordinating their inclinations), recommender frameworks are today unavoidable in our everyday online excursions.

In this project we tried to tackle a similar problem of overburden of choices when selecting books and try to help users by designing some recommendation systems that would suggest books based on the book’s popularity, book’s content and based upon the user’s previous choice and likes and dislikes. We used recommender systems that are too naive to very sophisticated personalized one and try to gauge each system to check their possible merits and demerits.
